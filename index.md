This page is the Landing page for my notes. The system is using Molecular notes. The outermost folder consists of atoms - standalone topics that are written in my own words for quick recap that provide enough overview to understand complex topics and applications.

Sources/ contains books, research papers, briefings, slides rewritten / summarised in my own terms. Cliff notes so to say.
Authors is simply the authors for the sources. Might be easier to find related research based on author when database grows larger. Plus adds structure to this unstructured form of data.

Topics/ may combine atoms. They generally encompass whole books within themselves. This is best described as a development of skills and projects. 

Molecules is the core of the notes - where critical thinking and linking of topics/atoms is supposed to happen. Potentially, we can link any topic to any other in best case - helping us grow in $O(N^2)$ . For example we can link physics and philosophy
