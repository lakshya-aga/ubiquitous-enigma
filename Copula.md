Copula is a function that can take the cumulative marginal probability function of each variable and give us a joint cumulative probability distribution function

Example:
$$
C(F_1(X_1), F_2(X_2)) = H(X_1, X_2)
$$
According to convention: Copula is made to be strictly non-decreasing. i.e. if all components are increasing, probability given by copula should increase or stay the same - which also makes sense because all components are probabilities themselves

What Happens if 2 functions already have a joint cumulative probability function: 
- One unique copula exists.
